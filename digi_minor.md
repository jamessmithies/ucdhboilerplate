### New Qualification/Subject/Endorsement   2016 
#### Proposal Description
**Purpose of the proposal**
(i)	To change the subject title ‘Digital Humanities’ to ‘Digital Practices’;
(ii)	 To introduce a Minor in ‘Digital Practices’ for the Bachelor of Arts degree;
(iii)	To introduce ‘Digital Practices’ as a subject for the Certificate in Arts.

**Executive Summary**
Employers are eager for self-motivated ‘work ready’ graduates who are comfortable working with digital tools, capable of translating complex technical information into accessible prose, aware of the ethical issues related to information technology, and experienced in managing projects and collaborating with teams.  By encouraging students to apply scholarly understanding, gained through intensive work in their core disciplines, to digital practices, we can complement their graduate profile with just these kinds of skills. In the undergraduate minor in Digital Practices Humanities students will learn to explore research questions using digital tools and methods, and develop a critical understanding of the possibilities and limitations of such approaches. They learn how to properly scope and manage a project, and have the opportunity to engage in work-integrated experiences. They learn about collaboration and team building, stakeholder management and communication. They also learn the technical skills and standards required to produce a scholarly digital project, and how to manage risks and issues.

The undergraduate minor in Digital Practices is central to the next phase in the development of the UC Digital Humanities programme, established in 2012. The strategy for the coming years is twofold: to develop an undergraduate cohort by implementing the minor in Digital Practices, and to package existing postgraduate courses into a Postgraduate Certificate in ‘Digital Arts and Humanities’. 

**Justification**
An Honours programme in ‘Digital Humanities’ was introduced in 2013. The programme was initiated in concert with the development of the CEISMIC Digital Earthquake Archive, using the first two years to establish courses and pedagogical principles, and understand the needs of students and staff across the new School of Humanities and Creative Arts and the wider College of Arts. This process has been an undoubted success: the UC CEISMIC Archive is very strongly positioned as the central data repository for quake-related digital archiving in the country, with relationships to over a dozen key local and national agencies involved in everything from cultural heritage to geoscience and infrastructure rebuild. It won the 2012 International Digital Humanities Prize as the Best Project for Public Audiences. The CEISMIC programme office is becoming a key resource for staff and students working in the digital arts, humanities and social sciences, as well as providing support for post-graduate research assistants and individual student projects. 

At the same time as these services have been developed, the Digital Humanities Programme has developed a local, national and international presence, run a very successful ‘THATCamp’ (The Humanities and Technology Camp), established a successful new 300-level course in Digital Literary Studies, altered existing Honours courses to better serve both students and also other College of Arts programmes, and created a new Honours course to offer an applied project option for students across all arts and humanities disciplines. The programme has provided postgraduate supervision at Honours level to English and Art History students, at Masters level to Mathematics and Statistics students, and at PhD level to Sociology and Media and Communications students. Two of the programme’s Honours courses are being used by the HITLab NZ for students, who wish to undertake a Master in Human Interface Technology, but lack the prerequisites. 

This proposal to introduce an undergraduate Minor in ‘Digital Practices’ will implement lessons learned from the first two years of the Honours programme in Digital Humanities, in particular the need for an undergraduate programme to provide the necessary skill base for postgraduate study. Undergraduate courses will also serve the needs of students across the College, whether they intend to go on to postgraduate study in this area or not.   It has become clear that the Digital Humanities Programme can best serve its School, College, and the wider University if it develops its own student cohort, but also, importantly, provides ‘outsourced’ services to other programmes in need of digital expertise. Several programmes across the College of Arts are in the process of building digital research and teaching capability, and they have expressed an interest in using staff from the Digital Humanities rather than going through the process of resourcing and hiring their own staff (even assuming resources or people with the correct skill-set could be found). This can be achieved by the continuing development of post-graduate options and by offering a Minor that can complement other programmes in the College of Arts. There are significant opportunities to deepen existing collaborations with the core Humanities subjects as well as Media and Communication, develop collaborations with Creative Arts, and explore the potential for contributions to several other subject areas in the College. Exciting opportunities exist to contribute to Maori and Indigenous Studies, helping that programme take advantage of opportunities for national and international leadership in the area. 

The proposed Minor in ‘Digital Practices’ aligns with the University’s strategic plan. It meets the challenge to develop curricula reflecting scholarship, societal need, digital literacy and virtual learning; it consolidates and expands current expertise in the Digital Humanities Programme; it assists the College in ensuring that students graduate with the up to date digital skills required for many areas of employment and research. 

The Minor in Digital Practices is also aligned with College and School plans, in particular:  

- The 2014 review of the Bachelor of Arts degree, which singled out the Digital Humanities and CEISMIC programme for special commendation, noting that “[t]he Panel gained a sense of intellectual energy and innovation from the staff involved in these programmes. The Panel hopes that they will be sustained and nurtured, and allowed to develop without the constraints of premature domestication (e.g., by conversion in to a major)”;
- The College of Arts 2015 Operational Plan, which supports the development of the Minor in Digital Practices.
- The Digital Humanities programme is becoming an important hub for the development of capability in the digital arts and humanities nationally. Paul Millar and James Smithies were keynote speakers at Otago University’s workshop on Digital Humanities in 2014. The Programme has a long-standing relationship with colleagues at Victoria University of Wellington. Our goal is to facilitate the development of digital arts and humanities at all New Zealand universities. The Minor in Digital Practices will offer another example to New Zealand universities interested in developing their capability in the area, and to University of Canterbury staff in other programmes who are interested in augmenting their course offerings with digital elements. 
- It should also be noted that Dr Smithies is an adjunct fellow at the University of Western Sydney Digital Humanities Group. In addition to being on the Board of New Zealand’s National Digital Forum and contributing to National eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) conference programme committees, he is a member of the Executive Committee of the Australasian Association of Digital Humanities, the transitional Executive Council of the global CentreNet initiative (http://www.dhcenternet.org/), the Conference Coordinating Committee of the international Alliance for Digital Humanities Organisations (http://adho.org/), and has contributed to two programme committees for the major global digital humanities conference, being held this year is Sydney. In addition to teaching Digital Humanities and co-supervising postgraduate theses in social sciences and Mathematics and Statistics, he contributes to undergraduate courses in Philosophy and English and provides guest lectures in Honours programmes in Art History, History and English.   

**Pasifika Content and Collaboration**
The Digital Humanities programme is developing strong links with Professor Steven Ratuva, Director, Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies particularly around offering advice and support to meet key objectives in the Centre’s ‘Plan for Strategic Growth’ relating to online publishing, creating an online community stories database, electronic publication of books and research, and online exhibitions. Wherever appropriate the skills to achieve such outcomes will be worked into the training the Digital Practices minor can offer Pasifika students, and students working on Pasifika themed projects.
As well, in developing the minor in Digital Practices, we have thought seriously about the intention in the university’s Pasifika Strategy to create “a diverse campus community…[with an] online learning environment [that] will be culturally inclusive, responsive and enriching”. We believe that offering digital training to Pasifika students, and developing Pasifika-themed digital resources, will help develop diversity and advance Pasifika strategies for communicating culture. We will work to actively incorporate Pasifika content in the minor, and to engage Pasifika students in digital projects that are relevant and of benefit to their communities.

**Graduate Profile**
Digital Humanities graduates will fill a gap produced after the ‘internet boom’ of the 1990s, when Humanities degrees began to get out of step with labour market requirements for graduates that are:

- capable of producing clear, concise analyses of technologically-oriented topics;
- conversant with a range of common digital tools used in small, medium and large organisations;
- aware of the constraints imposed by the technical requirements of information systems;
- aware of common project management and software development methodologies;
- capable of challenging the status-quo, as well as working comfortably within it;
- capable of critically analysing digital content to assess its quality and social value;
- comfortable interacting with a range of technical and non-technical people, and aiding communication between those people;
- aware of the difference between theoretical and applied knowledge, and comfortable with both;
- aware of the position of digital culture in society, and the role of new media.

Graduates will have been actively supported in their efforts to professionalize and move into the job market, making them highly attractive to employers in need to ‘workforce ready’ staff.

**Subject Title**
The decision to change the subject name to ‘Digital Practices’ from ‘Digital Humanities’ is the result of careful consideration. The College of Arts is small enough and its School structure such that it makes sense to deliver digital capability across all subjects, rather than focussing only on the humanities. Using the word ‘Practices’ offers the opportunity to incorporate arts and social science content as the minor develops while making it clear that it is distinguished by its ‘practical’ or ‘applied’ nature. Consideration was given to offering more options at 2nd and 3rd year level, in particular courses titled Digital Arts, and Digital History (incorporating content from Classics, History, Art History and History), but it was felt prudent to start small and develop additional courses if and when interest is received from the relevant departments. We believe the key to the success of the minor will be ensuring the ‘integrity’ of its ‘brand’, meaning care will need to be taken during expansion that additional courses have strong practical learning outcomes. Ideally, over time, the minor will grow to be an interdisciplinary undertaking with a broad variety of courses, and with the input of a broad variety of staff.

**Qualification**
We can confirm that the programme meets the relevant CUAP definition. It will offer “broad operational or technical and theoretical knowledge within a specific field of work or study” and “specialised technical or theoretical knowledge with depth in one or more fields of work or study”, as well as offering skills related to self-management and the management of others, the importance of leadership responsibility, and both generic and specialist skills in a professional knowledge domain.

**Acceptability of the programme and consultation**
The wider UC Digital Humanities Programme has been presented to digital humanities conferences in Australia and the United States, and is a founding member of the Praxis Network (http://praxis-network.org/), a group developed by scholars at Duke University, Michigan State University, University College London, University of Virginia, Brock University, Hope College, Graduate Centre CUNY, and the University of Canterbury, to showcase innovative and best practices in digital humanities education. It was recently presented to the New Zealand National Digital Forum (NDF) conference in Wellington (November 2014), an audience comprised of staff involved in digital initiatives in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. A Memorandum of Understanding is being developed with the Digital Humanities Group at the University of Western Sydney that involves the possibility of co-teaching and course-sharing initiatives.

The proposals to introduce a minor and postgraduate certificate in ‘Digital Practices’ have received a very positive response from stakeholders in industry and community organizations. In his keynote address to the National Digital Forum in November 2014, new Te Papa CEO Rick Ellis talked about the need for ‘digital entrepreneurship’ from New Zealand’s cultural heritage sector. The Minor in Digital Practices is designed to fulfil this need. Chair of the National Digital Forum and Web Team Manager at the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, Matthew Oliver, noted that:

>Much of the work undertaken in the cultural heritage sector at the moment requires at the very least an understanding of technology by people engaged with the content and an understanding of content by those involved in the technology. People with skills in both areas are increasingly in high demand and are helping reimagine our history.

As a Board member of the National Digital Forum (New Zealand’s primary forum related to digital cultural heritage, supported by all the major cultural heritage institutions) Senior Lecturer in Digital Humanities James Smithies is in a good position to understand the requirements of relevant professional, industry and community organisations. In addition to receiving emails from professionals enquiring about the availability of post-graduate degrees (see appendix A), he has been assured that the digital arts and humanities community would welcome a Minor in Digital Practices. This assurance comes in the form of emails (see Appendix B) and positive feedback following a talk at the National Digital Forum conference in November 2014, where the new qualification was described. Michael Lascarides, Manager, New Zealand National Library Online (formerly New York Public Library) noted on Twitter that the initiative was a “Great idea”, and was supported in that by Tim Sherratt, Manager, Trove, National Library of Australia. Academic colleagues working in the Digital Humanities in Australia and the United States have provided positive feedback about the Minor too. Dr. Bethany Nowviskie, Director of the high-profile ‘Scholars’ Lab’ at the University of Virginia, was excited the initiative has been developed “as a practice-oriented minor that could fit in with any number of majors”. Kath Bode, Senior Lecturer in Literary and Textual Studies, Centre for Digital Humanities Research, Australian National University, commented that the “approach resonates with the one [they] are pursuing at the Australian National University, where [their] new Digital Humanities minor in the Bachelor of Arts” begins this year. Tom Scheinfeldt, Associate Professor in the Departments of Digital Media & Design and History and Director of Digital Humanities in the Digital Media Centre at the University of Connecticut, noted the proposal was “extremely exciting” and he liked “the emphasis on connecting with indigenous community needs”  (see Appendix C). Feedback has been uniformly positive, but has impressed on us the need to implement the program as currently conceived, and in particular its balance of scholarly and practical outcomes and focus on augmenting the core disciplines in an effort to ‘lift all boats in the harbour’.

Positive verbal feedback has been received from the College of Arts Academic Management Committee, and Faculty Standing Committee.

**Treaty of Waitangi**
In defining the role the Digital Practices Minor will play in developing students who are aware of and understand the nature of bi-culturalism in Aotearoa New Zealand and its relevance to their studies, we have sought advice from the office of the DVC Maori, and from Kaiārahi Māori  Lynne-Harata Te Aika,  and from Te Runanga o Ngāi Tahu via their Senior Archivist, Jill Durney. We have also looked closely at the role Digital Humanities can play in developing projects for indigenous and first nations peoples.

Te Runanga o Ngāi Tahu advise that they wish us to continue to develop a strong relationship with the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre, which was a founding member of the CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive consortium. We will build on this relationship by following the Chief Archivist’s advice to give “graduates exposure/relationship with Ngāi Tahu that can be built on in the future for either working for us or assisting with us on joint archival digitisation projects…I think a close working relationship would see some worthwhile experience for the students and some mahi and/or thinking on some of our digitisation projects in the future.” We will look at using internships and field trips to develop and strengthen these connections.

Following Kaiārahi Māori  Lynne-Harata Te Aika’s advice to create modules that develop bicultural themes and understanding for all students; examining and documenting Maori themes and knowledge, as well as encouraging Maori students to express their language, culture and identity, we will begin by exposing students to a range of  indigenous digital humanities projects such as:
- the Mukhayyam al-sumud al-usturi tal al-Za`tar project for survivors and descendants of the 1976 siege and destruction of the Tal al-Za`tar refugee camp in Beirut; 
- Australia’s Western Arnhem Plateau Project documenting the social and environmental history on the western Arnhem Land Plateau in the Northern Territory; 
- Australia’s Bidwern project contributing to the technical development of the National Recording Project for Indigenous Performance in Australia (NRPIPA); 
- and the AUSTLANG online Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages database. 

Such practical examples will inform a module teaching about current trends in the digitization of indigenous heritage materials, explaining the relevance of projects internationally that seek to enlist tribal communities in co-curation of their source materials, and detail the challenges currently faced by tribal museums, archives and libraries who want to conduct their own independent digitization projects. There will also be scope to examine ways in which technology can challenge embedded colonial assumptions by extending learning experiences beyond traditional teaching structures. Further opportunities will then exist to show how evolving social media leads to the development of new forms of social activism and assertions of identity, and how the use of computational approaches can help generate new understandings of the formation of the bicultural nation, using technology to create a bicultural digital discourse for Aotearoa/New Zealand’s.

Utimately Maori and non-Maori students will be encouraged to develop practical projects to explore ways to disseminate their findings to a wider audience, and unlock relevant archives and records using digital tools, just as Dr Christopher Thomson of the Digital Humanities programme is currently doing by Digitizing Kōmako—an annotated bibliography of writing by Māori in English, compiled and edited by Dr Bridget Underhill.

**Goals of the programme**
In purely practical terms the goal is to develop a cohort of students who are aware of the range of digital practices available to arts and humanities students, and the opportunities offered by the wider digital field. This is secondary, however, to respond to changing market and workforce demands, and the need to ensure prospective postgraduate students have the skills required to undertake advanced research in technical topics in the arts and humanities.  The goal is to ensure core Arts disciplines retain continuity with their tradition, while offering students the opportunity to augment their degree with digital options. Students will major in History, English, Classics (etc) as normal, but be able to add the minor in Digital Practices to their degree to ensure they have hands-on experience with digital tools, are prepared for advanced research in arts and humanities subjects, and can demonstrate to employers the value of their degree. We believe this ‘protects’ the core arts and humanities disciplines from the ever-changing cycle of digital tools and methods, while offering students the experience and skills they need for the modern world.
A subsidiary goal is to develop a ‘dual track’ option, not only for arts and humanities, but also for engineering students. By coordinating activities with the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and the HIT Lab NZ, the hope is that undergraduate students from both sides of campus will feel more comfortable blending their degrees and developing skills ‘across the spectrum’. This is an important strategic move, made in recognition of the fact that the future workforce is expected to need people confident in both the liberal arts and technology. It is also designed to produce students capable of undertaking interdisciplinary post-graduate work involving a blend of subjects from the arts, humanities, and engineering disciplines. It reflects programmes like Stanford’s CS+X (https://undergrad.stanford. edu/academic-planning/majors-minors/joint-majors-csx).

**Outcome statement**
Graduates from the Digital Practices minor will have a blend of traditional humanities-related skills and 21st Century applied ones. They will have an understanding of the moral and ethical issues surrounding technologies and the digital world, the ability to write clear, concise prose, and an understanding of the technical constraints imposed by information systems. They will be comfortable using and critically assessing a range of technologies, and the ability to apply those skills to new technologies as they encounter them. This makes them well suited to work in all new media and digital industries, but especially ones requiring a blend of analytical and technical skills. Graduates would be suitable for work in research, relationship management, business analysis within the creative and cultural heritage sector, digital archiving, project management, and the mainstream (non-digital) creative and cultural heritage sectors. They will be particularly suited to policy analysis positions related to technology and culture, and any position that requires communication across technical and non-technical teams. 

**University graduate characteristics and Qualification graduate profile**
The Minor in Digital Practices strongly reflects the new University graduate profile. The programme is, in particular, designed to enhance the employability of graduates, and to offer them options in a global employment marketplace. The goal is to get ‘ahead of the curve’ in undergraduate education by blending arts, humanities, and technology-related disciplines. This will create students who are confident in their abilities and capable of engaging in entrepreneurial activities, either as initiators or start-up team-members. The framework being put in place invites participation from Ngai Tahu and facilitates exploration of the relationship between the digital and indigenous worlds. Connections with the UC CEISMIC Digital Archive, College of Arts Internship Programme, and Macmillan Brown Library offer a range of opportunities for community outreach and wellbeing. The Minor relates to the University’s graduate profile in the following ways:

- ‘Employable, innovative and enterprising’: see above and Appendix C for graduate profile examples.
- ‘Critically competent in a core academic discipline of their degree’: the Digital Practices Minor is not intended to deliver core disciplinary competencies in and of itself. It complements core academic disciplines – and is delivered within them - to extend students’ capabilities in their chosen area.
- ‘Globally aware’: International ties are being developed with the University of Western Sydney and Leipzig University, and the possibility has been raised with a number of other institutions. A Dartmouth student was supervised by the Digital Humanities programme in 2013, funded by the National eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) and the Ministry for Business and Innovation. Dr Stephen Hardman, International and Internship Coordinator, has “spoken to a number of European and North American universities and there is real enthusiasm for joint Digital Humanities collaborations with UC”.
- ‘Bi-culturally competent and confident’: The intention is to make this a key outcome of the Digital Practices Minor. The global digital humanities community is eager for New Zealand to lead in the development of tools and methods that can enable and empower indigenous communities worldwide. The Digital Humanities programme is conscious this needs to be driven from within local communities, and result from ongoing dialogue. 
- ‘Engaged with the community’: Digital internship projects have already been run and there is considerable scope to extend this aspect of the Minor. Dr. Stephen Hardman, International and Internship Coordinator, notes that the proposed Minor fits well  “with Work Integrated Learning developments, including developments in internships, and Professional and Community Engagement initiatives across the College as students develop key skills and work on ‘real’ community projects”.

Graduates with a minor in Digital Practices will be:
- capable of producing clear, concise analyses of technologically-oriented topics;
- conversant with a range of common digital tools used in small, medium and large organisations;
- aware of the constraints imposed by the technical requirements of information systems;
- aware of common project management and software development methodologies;
- able to contribute innovative perspectives to society and the workplace, as well as working within established norms;
- capable of critically analysing digital content to assess its quality and social value;
- comfortable interacting with a range of technical and non-technical people, and aiding communication between those people;
- aware of the difference between theoretical and applied knowledge, and comfortable with both;
- aware of the position of digital culture in society, and the role of new media.

**Programme overview**
Students intending to complete the BA with a minor in Digital Practices must be credited with at least 75 points including at least 45 points at 200-level or above in courses from the Digital Practices schedule, HITD201, and either ARTS 295 or ARTS 395.  There are two compulsory courses, DIGI 102 and DIGI 201.  Internship courses – ARTS 295, ARTS 395 - that are to be credited to the Digital Practices Minor must be approved in advance by the Programme Co-ordinator.

The Minor will be ‘anchored’ by the two first year courses, both existing courses in the College of Arts and Computer Science. These will be co-coded as ‘DIGI’ courses to reflect the Digital Practices minor. In taking these courses students will gain new skills, and keep their options open for study at higher levels:

- DIGI 101 / COSC 110 (S1): Working in a Digital World. This course provides students with an understanding of how the digital world is engineered, and exposes them to a range of tools commonly used by knowledge workers. It will be co-taught by staff from Computer Science and Digital Humanities.
- DIGI 102 / PHIL 137 (S2): Computers, Artificial Intelligence and the Information Society. This course begins with an overview of the history of computing and the information society from 1950 – 2000 before introducing the history and logic of artificial intelligence. The course is co-taught with staff from Digital Humanities, Philosophy and the HIT Lab NZ, and includes tutorials with interactive technologies such as robotics and 3D printing.

Co-coded courses (including one new course), internship courses, and a course from the Human Interface Technology programme will provide second and third year options for students taking the Minor.   The co-coded courses, DIGI 201 and DIGI 301 will be co-ordinated by the Digital Humanities Programme and utilise the expertise a variety of lecturers from across the College of Arts. Where applicable, these courses will be cross-coded with core College of Arts disciplines.

- DIGI 201 / CULT 213 (S1): Digital Cultures. This is a new course. It will be co-taught by staff in Digital Humanities, Cultural Studies, Media and Communications, and Journalism. The course challenges students to critically assess digital cultures, and their relationship to them. Students engage with digital tools they might not have experienced before, and consider how a range of digital tools enable, restrict and/or undermine their role as citizens.
- HITD 201: Design Thinking (SU2). Design Thinking is a problem solving methodology that helps students and innovators to approach today’s problems from a new perspective. This multi-disciplinary process involves the involvement of users at an early stage and rapid prototyping throughout. The course will be delivered by staff from the HIT Lab. By including it in the Digital Practices minor students will be able to position themselves (with the addition of Honours-level papers in Digital Humanities or engineering-related disciplines) for post-graduate study at the HIT Lab NZ.
- DIGI301 /ENGL 345: Digital Literary Studies (S2). This course currently exists as ENGL 345: Digital Literary Studies. It attracted 20 students in its first year (2014) and was positively reviewed. The course explores the history and theory of digital literary studies and exposes students to computational methods to augment literary scholarship.
- ARTS 295 Internship or ARTS395: Internship (S1,S2, Anytime Start): These courses provide an opportunity to apply skills acquired through academic study to a project designed by a local company or community group in a New Zealand context. Internships will be approved and supervised by the Digital Humanities Programme, subject to availability of a suitable placement.

**Proposed teaching/delivery methods**
The Minor will use a range of teaching methods including lectures, seminars, tutorials and practical laboratories. Students will also produce applied projects.

**Prescriptions for courses**
- DIGI 101 / COSC 101: Working in a Digital World. *Existing course co-coded into the DIGI programme*.
An introduction to computers, how they work, and what they can and cannot do. Software packages for word processing, spreadsheets, databases are taught.  This is a non-advancing course. 
- DIGI 102 / PHIL 137: Computers, Artificial Intelligence, and the Information Society. *Existing course co-coded into the DIGI programme*.
Our art, culture, politics, society and economy are powered by computing machines.  This course will provide a history of computing from the 1930s to the present day, offering students an introduction to the fundamentals of computing technology, the corporations who sells us our devices and software, and moral and ethical issues at the heart of the information society. The course also examines Artificial Intelligence.  What is AI and can it be achieved?  How could you tell whether a computer has a mind? Is the human brain in fact a computer?
•	DIGI 201 /CULT 213: Digital Cultures. *New course*.
The course challenges students to critically assess digital cultures, and their relationship to them. Students engage with digital tools they might not have experienced before, and consider how a range of digital tools enable, restrict and/or undermine their role as citizens.
•	DIGI301 /ENGL345: Digital Literary Studies. *Existing course co-coded into the DIGI programme*.
Digital Literary Studies is a new field that uses digital technology to interpret literature and its cultural context, and publish research findings.  The course includes close readings of texts as well as applied aspects to offer students a broad overview of the field and prepare them for Honours work in Digital Humanities. No technical skills are required

**Assessment and moderation procedures**
Traditional essays will be used to build and assess students’ critical, analytical and written skills. Additional assessment will use a broad range of assessment techniques, including blog posts, Wikipedia entries, forums, essays, response papers, and in-class tests. Computational analysis of literary and historical texts will be undertaken in workshops, and assessed through an examination of both elementary programming concepts and (especially) the scholarly interpretation of computational outputs. Hands-on tutorials will be accompanied by written response papers relating the experience to scholarly topics in the arts and humanities.

**Resources**
No additional staff are required. Courses will be convened by the Digital Humanities Programme, and draw on staff from both the College of Arts and other Colleges.

The Digital Humanities Programme has gathered a range of resources. A multi-site Wordpress install will be used for class blogs, a proposed multi-site Omeka install will be used for web archiving projects, and either the Raspberry Pi or Arduino (or similar platform such as http://littlebits.cc/) will be used for rapid hardware and software prototyping. Free online services will be used where appropriate.

Robots and 3D printers will be sourced from HIT Lab NZ.
The Library has been developing resources in support of the Digital Humanities Programme since its inception in 2012. Many more resources are available through the global digital humanities community free of charge.

A working relationship exists with the College of Arts Internship Programme for placement of interested students into workplaces as part of that programme.

UC has particular strengths in digital humanities, the history and philosophy of computing, high performance computing, and augmented reality.  The UC CEISMIC Digital Archive Programme Office, already established with 2 dual-boot Apple – Windows computers, can be used if demand requires it. Normal lecture and tutorial rooms will be used for other teaching.

**Plans for monitoring programme quality**
- The programme will conduct an internal review of all course offerings and results annually, focussing on learning outcomes.
- Students will evaluate all classes, teaching and supervision through the STU survey. They may also submit their own recommendations and responses through the Class Rep or directly to teaching staff at regular staff / student Liaison meetings.
- Peer review of course offerings and student work by fully qualified External Moderators from humanities and (where appropriate) computer science programmes.
- Mentoring: regular meetings with the Head of the School of Humanities and Creative Arts and senior academics in the School of Humanities.

**Review of the programme**
- Full programme review in 3 years.
- Graduating year review.
- 5 yearly programme review.
