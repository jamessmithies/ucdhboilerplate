# Course Description
This course lays the theoretical and methodological foundation for an Honours degree in Digital Humanities. It will also be of interest to students from other Humanities disciplines interested in building a digital component into their degree. It provides a history of humanities computing, and its development through the ‘computational turn’ into Digital Humanities over the last decade. You will be challenged to consider what it means to be a digital humanist, and attend seminars in technological determinism, systems theory, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data visualization, TEI (The Humanities Text Encoding Initiative), text analysis and the nature of digital texts, algorithmic criticism and distant reading, open source and open access movements, digital forensics, crowd-sourcing, and materiality. The course is designed to give students a broad overview of the field so they can decide what areas they might like to specialise in. It is highly recommended for those wishing to progress to Masters and Doctoral studies. The goal is to offer students a broad education in digital humanities, from theory to elementary programming and system design. Students are encouraged to take DIGI 401 in conjunction with courses in other Humanities disciplines, and those interested in further developing their technical skills are encouraged to progress to courses offered by Computer Science and Engineering.

The course is designed in 4 modules, each corresponding to a core knowledge area:

**Module 1:** History of Digital Humanities, Project Management and Software Development

**Module 2:** Digital Humanities theory

**Module 3:** Digital Humanities method

**Module 4:** Applied Digital Humanities

# Class Times
TBC. ATTENDANCE IS COMPULSORY.

# Teaching Delivery
Teaching will be based on traditional lectures, with weekly tutorials based on lecture topics, or practical laboratories where students can explore applied aspects of the course.    

# Assessment
Students will be required to produce a 3500 word essay (30%), a second essay **or** digital project (30%), contribute 4 posts to the class blog (30%), and participate in 2 code-related laboratories (10%).   

1. 3500 word essay. Due: dd/mm/yyyy. 
2. Either a second 3500 word essay, or a digital project using a blog, Omeka, Scalar, Neatline, TEI (other options possible following discussion with course convener). Due: dd/mm/yyyy.
3. Blog posts: At least 4 contributions to the class blog.
4. Coding laboratories: Attendance and participation only. 2 required (Mobile Programming, TEI, Web Scraping and Topic Modelling, GIS, or Python).

**Note**: Students interested in delivering a digital project instead of a second essay should consult with the course convener as soon as possible.

# Course Readings
Readings for each class will be posted on the LEARN site. Students are expected to download copies, print them out or load them onto a mobile device, and bring them to class. There are many resources available online, but see especially:
Schreibman, Susan, Ray Siemens, and John Unsworth. A Companion to Digital Humanities. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Professional, 2004. 
**Note**: Many of the lectures and tutorials list significant amounts of reading. While some reading is required for all lectures and tutorials, students are encouraged to decide how much you want to prepare for yourself. Work out what you want to focus on over the entire course, and ensure that you prepare enough to contribute to every class in some way.

# Outcome
At the end of the course you will have a broad understanding of the digital humanities, along with basic technical and project management skills. You will be comfortable working in the online world and understand the nature and requirements of online scholarship.

# Dishonest Practice
Digital Humanities is a collaborative discipline by nature, but dishonest practices will be treated very seriously. Students found to be engaging in dishonest practices will be dealt with under the University Discipline Regulations. Penalties range from refusal to grade the assignment in question, to exclusion from the University. The Digital Humanities Program understands ‘dishonest practice’ to include:

- Plagiarism: The presentation of any material without adequate acknowledgement of the source. This includes text, data, figures, computer code etc, on any medium (print or online). All sources should be adequately referenced, following accepted scholarly standards. Refer to the latest edition of the MLA Style Manual for more information.
- Collusion: Working with another person or persons and presenting it as if it was your work alone. While collaboration and discussion is important in the digital humanities, students need to be careful about acknowledging everyone who has had a significant involvement in their work. If you have questions about this, or would like to suggest joint acknowledgement, read http://faircite.wordpress.com/ and contact James Smithies.
- Ghost Writing: Using another person to write an essay or assignment for you. This applies whether they are paid or not.
