# Course Description
This course does not assume students have taken Introduction to Digital Humanities but is designed to complement the theoretical and practical knowledge they gain in that course. It will run in the semester following Introduction to foster continuity of the learning experience. The focus will be less on the theoretical and practical components of Digital Humanities, and more on the development of critical skills specific to the digital world. Rather than being a straight-forward application of critical theory to new media, the course will encourage a critical assessment of new media based on cognizance of its engineered nature and relationship to society. Topics will include cybernetics, the ethics of information systems, closed versus open computing systems, the internet and human ethics, blogging, neo-liberalism and new media, hyper-rationalization and IT, the digital avant-garde, software studies, digital hyper-reality and the panopticon, videogames, social media and the ‘Twitter revolutions’, hypertext literature, and the nature of Wikipedia. Students will be expected to produce 2 3500 word essays. Public blog posts or Wikipedia entries will be required for all tutorials, which will include analysis of both ‘open’ and ‘closed’ digital systems (desktop, tablet / phone). Students will need to use the Anthologize tool to develop a portfolio of their blog writing for submission at the end of the course.

# Class Times
TBC. ATTENDANCE IS COMPULSORY.

# Teaching Delivery
Teaching will be based on traditional lectures, with weekly tutorials based on lecture topics.    

# Assessment  
Students will be required to produce either 2 3500 word essays, **or** a 3500 word essay and a digital project (60%), contribute 4 posts to the course blog (20%), and take an in-class test (20%).  

**Note**: Students interested in delivering a digital project instead of a second essay should consult with the course convener as soon as possible.

# Course Readings
Readings for each class will be posted on the LEARN site. Students are expected to download copies, print them out or load them onto a mobile device, and bring them to class. There are many resources other resources available online.
**Note**: Many of the lectures and tutorials list significant amounts of reading. While some reading is required for all lectures and tutorials, students are encouraged to decide how much you want to prepare for yourself. Work out what you want to focus on over the entire course, and ensure that you prepare enough to contribute to every class in some way.

# Outcome
At the end of the course you will have a broad understanding of the relationship between New Media and the humanities, as well as a solid understanding of the Digital Humanities. You will be confident critiquing all forms of digital culture and understand the way that culture is developed and disseminated.

# Dishonest Practice
Digital Humanities is a collaborative discipline by nature, but dishonest practices will be treated very seriously. Students found to be engaging in dishonest practices will be dealt with under the University Discipline Regulations. Penalties range from refusal to grade the assignment in question, to exclusion from the University. The Digital Humanities Program understands ‘dishonest practice’ to include:

- Plagiarism: The presentation of any material without adequate acknowledgement of the source. This includes text, data, figures, computer code etc, on any medium (print or online). All sources should be adequately referenced, following accepted scholarly standards. Refer to the latest edition of the MLA Style Manual for more information.
- Collusion: Working with another person or persons and presenting it as if it was your work alone. While collaboration and discussion is important in the digital humanities, students need to be careful about acknowledging everyone who has had a significant involvement in their work. If you have questions about this, or would like to suggest joint acknowledgement, read http://faircite.wordpress.com/ and contact James Smithies.
- Ghost Writing: Using another person to write an essay or assignment for you. This applies whether they are paid or not.

# Tutorials
**Tutorial 1: Wordpress**   
 
Set up a new blog for your course assignments. http://wordpress.com/ is recommended, because its open source version is great for Digital Humanities applications, but you can use whichever platform you prefer. Other options include Blogger, Tumblr and Posterous. Things to do:

1.	Submit your first ‘getting started’ post.
2.	Include a blog roll of DH and New Media sites you’re interested in.
3.	Copy and paste your RSS feed to the class Moodle forum.

Note: It’s ok to have your blog ready for this laboratory beforehand! If you do that you can use the lab to polish things.

2.	Are the attitudes of the pre-digital authors relevant to the digital age?
3.	What’s more important here, continuity or change?
4.	In Benjamin’s analysis, what effect has modernity had on art and aesthetics? Does this apply equally to the digital age?
